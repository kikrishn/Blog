Let $n$ be a positive integer $\geq 1$. Let $V$ be an $n$ dimensional vector space over a field $F$, and $L(V,V)$ be the set of endomorphisms of $V$. The set $L(V,V)$ has a canonical structure of a vector space over $F$, and its dimension is $n^2$. 

Fix a nonzero element $T$ in $L(V,V)$. Then the set of endomorphisms $1, T, \ldots , T^{n^2}$ are linearly dependent over $F$, so that there exist elements $a_0, \ldots, a_{n^2}$ in $F$, not all zero, such that 

$$a_0 \cdot 1 + a_1 \cdot T + \ldots + a_{n^2} \cdot T^{n^2} = 0.$$

In other words, $T$ satisfies the polynomial $a_0 + a_1 t + \ldots + a_{n^2} t^{n^2} \in F[t]$. In general, the set of polynomials $f(X)$ in $F[X]$ such that $f(T) = 0$ forms an ideal in $F[t]$, and since $F[t]$ is a principal ideal domain, the ideal is generated by a monic polynomial $m(t)$, called the **minimal polynomial** of $T$. In other words, the polynomial $m(t)$ is the polynomial of least degree which $T$ satisfies and if $f(T) = 0$ then $m(t)$ divides $f(t)$. **Note that $m(t)$ is not necessarily irreducible over $F$.**

One more observation in order. The minimal polynomial $m(T)$ kills the entire space $V$. The first idea that might be expected to give additional information is to study not only polynomials $f(t)$ such that $f(T)$ annihilates $V$, but also polynomials in $T$ which send individual vectors to zero. The simplest case is that of a polynomial $t-\alpha$. That is, given $\alpha \in F$, we ask for vectors $v \in V$ such that $(T - \alpha)v = 0$, and we call $\alpha$ an eigenvalue of $T$ if there exists a nonzero vector $v \in V$ such that $T(v) = \alpha v$, and any nonzero vector satisfying this equation is called a **eigenvector** corresponding to the eigenvalue $\alpha$. 

**Example:** Consider the vector space $\mathcal{F}(\mathbb{R})$ of all functions $f: \mathbff{R} \to \mathbb{R}$, and $V$ be the subspace consisting of differentiable functions. Clearly the operation of differentiation defines a linear transformation 

$$d: V \to \mathcal{F}(\mathbb{R}).$$

A nonzero function $f$ is an eigenvector of $d$ if for some $\alpha \in \mathbb{R}$, we have $d(f) = \alpha f$. Clearly the exponential functions $e^{\alpha t}$ are the eigenvectors of $d$, and the theory of linear differential equations of the first order shows that these are the only eigenvectors of $d$.
