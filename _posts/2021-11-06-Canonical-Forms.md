Let $n$ be a positive integer $\geq 1$. Let $V$ be an $n$ dimensional vector space over a field $F$, and $L(V,V)$ be the set of endomorphisms of $V$. The set $L(V,V)$ has a canonical structure of a vector space over $F$, and its dimension is $n^2$. 


Fix a nonzero element $T$ in $L(V,V)$. Then the set of endomorphisms $1, T, \ldots , T^{n^2}$ are linearly dependent over $F$, so that there exist elements $a_0, \ldots, a_{n^2}$ in $F$, not all zero, such that 
$$
a_0 \cdot 1 + a_1 \cdot T + \ldots + a_{n^2} \cdot T^{n^2} = 0.
$$
In other words, $T$ satisfies the polynomial $a_0 + a_1 X + \ldots + a_{n^2} X^{n^2}$ in $F[X]$. In general, the set of polynomials $f(X)$ in $F[X]$ such that $f(T) = 0$ forms an ideal in $F[X]$, and since $F[X]$ is a principal ideal domain, it is generated by a monic polynomial $m(X)$, called the minimal polynomial of $T$. In other words, the polynomial $m(X)$ is the least degree polynomial which $T$ satisfies and if $T$ satisfies any other polynomial $f(X)$ then $m(X)$ divides $f(X)$. Note that $m(X)$ is not necessarily irreducible over $F$.
