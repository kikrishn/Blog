Let $F$ be a field and $V$ and $W$ be vector spaces over $F$ of dimensions $m$ and $n$ respectively. Let $f: V \to W$ be a linear map. Given a basis of $V$ and a basis of $W$, the map $f$ is completely determined by the $\textrm{dim} V \times \textrm{dim} W$ number of scalars in $F$. In analogy, let $g: V \times W \to X$ be a $F$-bilinear map, where $X$ is some finite dimensional vector space over $F$. Given a bases of $V, W$ and $X$, the map $g$ is unambiguously determined by $\textrm{dim} V \times \textrm{dim} W \times \textrm{dim} X$ number of scalars in $F$. Conversely, we would like to know whether the $g$ is determined uniquely by its values on the pairs in a given subset of $V \times W$. In the linear case, $f$ is determined uniquely provided $f$ is known on a set that is a basis of $V$; in other words, $f$ is known on a set that is linearly independent over $F$ and spans $V$.
